# 🚀 LaunchDarkly with AWS ECS: Feature Flags & Progressive Delivery

## 📌 Overview
LaunchDarkly enables **feature flagging** and **progressive delivery** for AWS ECS applications. It allows you to:
- **Deploy features safely** without full rollouts
- **Control feature visibility** without redeploying ECS
- **Instantly enable/disable features** in production
- **Gradually roll out features** to selected users

## 📂 Deployment Process
1. **Developer pushes code to GitHub**
2. **Harness builds Docker image** and deploys to ECS
3. **LaunchDarkly integration in Harness**
4. **Feature toggles control feature activation** (even after ECS deployment)

## 🎯 Key Features of LaunchDarkly
### ✅ Feature Toggles
- Control whether a feature is enabled or disabled **without deploying a new ECS version**.

### 🔄 Progressive Delivery (Gradual Rollouts)
- **Percentage-based rollouts** (e.g., 5% → 20% → 100%)
- **User segmentation** (e.g., Only enable for premium users)
- **Geolocation-based rollouts** (e.g., US first, then global)

### 🛑 Instant Kill Switch
- If an issue occurs, disable the feature in **LaunchDarkly**, avoiding the need for ECS rollback.

### 📊 A/B Testing & Experimentation
- Show different feature versions to different users and analyze performance.

## ⏪ Rollback Strategies
| **Scenario**                    | **Fix with LaunchDarkly?** | **ECS Rollback Needed?** |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Bug in a feature behind a flag   | ✅ Just disable the flag | ❌ No redeployment needed |
| UI change that users dislike     | ✅ Disable feature instantly  | ❌ No redeployment needed |
| Breaking API change in ECS       | ❌ Feature flag won’t help | ✅ Redeploy v9 in ECS |
| Database migration issue         | ❌ Feature flag won’t help | ✅ Restore DB & ECS |

## 🚀 Best Practices
1. **Wrap risky features with feature flags** ✅
2. **Keep old logic in the ECS version** (don’t delete v9 logic immediately) ⏪
3. **Use gradual rollouts & monitor performance** 📊
4. **Test new features in staging before production** 🧪
5. **Use LaunchDarkly to rollback features quickly** instead of redeploying ECS 🛑
